# Twitter-Clone
The goal of this project is to implement a Twitter Clone and a client tester/simulator in F# using Actor model. The problem statement is to implement an engine that can be paired up with WebSockets to provide full functionality. The client part (send/receive tweets) and the engine (distribute tweets) were simulated in separate OS processes.
